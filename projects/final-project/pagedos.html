      <p> An averege person spends about 90,000 hours at work over their lifetime. Therefore it is important to understand how social stratifications including class can limit our job reach but it is also important to recognize that one can grow beyond such limitations.  Self awareness within the workplace allows for growth and how we perceive ones self and others. </p>
